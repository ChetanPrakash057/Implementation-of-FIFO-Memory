# Implementation-of-FIFO-Memory
Designed 16 stages and 8-bit data-width FIFO memory using Verilog HDL. First-in, first-out (FIFO) memory chips are used in buffering applications between devices that operate at different speeds or in applications where data must be stored temporarily for further processing.
